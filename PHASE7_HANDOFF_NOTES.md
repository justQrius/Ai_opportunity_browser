## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Implementation Details

### Key Design Decisions:
1. **Competitive Analysis**: Used Porter's Five Forces framework for systematic competitive assessment
2. **Technology Recommendations**: Implemented category-based tech stack with complexity-aware selection
3. **Implementation Phases**: Created standard 4-5 phase approach with effort estimation algorithms
4. **Integration**: Full integration with existing BusinessIntelligenceService and API router

### Error Handling:
- Comprehensive exception handling in all service methods
- Graceful degradation for malformed opportunity data
- Proper logging throughout all operations
- HTTP error responses with appropriate status codes

### Testing:
- Unit tests for all business logic methods
- Edge case testing for malformed data
- Integration test scenarios for API endpoints
- Mock objects for database and external dependencies

## üîÑ Next Steps

Based on the tasks.md file, the next logical tasks would be:

### Immediate Next: Task 7.2.2 - Build Timeline Estimation
- Create development timeline algorithms
- Add resource requirement analysis
- **Dependencies**: 7.2.1 (COMPLETED)

### Following: Task 7.2.3 - Implement Team Composition Analysis  
- Build skill requirement identification
- Add team size and role recommendations
- **Dependencies**: 7.2.2

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Configuration Requirements:
- No additional environment variables required
- Services use existing database connections and configurations
- All recommendations are algorithm-based, no external API dependencies

### Performance Considerations:
- Competitive analysis processes market signals in memory - may need optimization for large datasets
- Technology recommendations use rule-based logic - fast execution
- Implementation planning calculations are lightweight

### Maintenance:
- Technology recommendation database in `_initialize_technology_database()` may need periodic updates
- Known competitors database in competitive analysis should be updated as market evolves
- Architecture pattern ratings may need adjustment based on real-world feedback
