# Community Features API Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented Task 6.3.2 - "Build community features API" with comprehensive discussion and comment endpoints, plus voting and feedback mechanisms.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Database Models (`shared/models/discussion.py`)

#### Discussion Model
- **Purpose**: Represent discussion threads for opportunities
- **Key Features**:
  - Thread-based discussions linked to opportunities
  - Multiple discussion types (general, technical, market_analysis, implementation, business_model)
  - Discussion status management (active, locked, archived, deleted)
  - Community engagement metrics (upvotes, downvotes, view count)
  - Moderation capabilities (flagging, moderator review)
  - Pinning support for important discussions

#### Comment Model
- **Purpose**: Represent threaded comments within discussions
- **Key Features**:
  - Hierarchical threading with depth tracking
  - Reply count management
  - Community voting (upvotes, downvotes)
  - Soft deletion support
  - Moderation features (flagging, review status)
  - Maximum nesting depth enforcement (5 levels)

#### Voting Models
- **DiscussionVote**: User votes on discussions
- **CommentVote**: User votes on comments
- **Key Features**:
  - Unique constraint prevents duplicate votes
  - Support for upvote/downvote with type changes
  - Vote removal by re-voting same type

### 2. Database Relationships

- **User** → **Discussion**: One-to-many (authored_discussions)
- **User** → **Comment**: One-to-many (comments)
- **User** → **DiscussionVote**: One-to-many (discussion_votes)
- **User** → **CommentVote**: One-to-many (comment_votes)
- **Opportunity** → **Discussion**: One-to-many (discussions)
- **Discussion** → **Comment**: One-to-many (comments)
- **Comment** → **Comment**: Self-referencing for threading (parent/replies)

### 3. API Schemas (`shared/schemas/discussion.py`)

#### Request Schemas
- **DiscussionCreate**: Create new discussions
- **DiscussionUpdate**: Update existing discussions
- **CommentCreate**: Create new comments with optional parent
- **CommentUpdate**: Update comment content
- **VoteRequest**: Submit votes on discussions/comments

#### Response Schemas
- **DiscussionResponse**: Full discussion data with engagement metrics
- **CommentResponse**: Comment data with threading info and user votes
- **VoteResponse**: Vote result with updated counts
- **DiscussionStats**: Community statistics

#### Search & Filtering
- **DiscussionSearch**: Advanced search with multiple filters
- Support for filtering by type, status, author, pinned status
- Sorting by activity, creation date, or vote counts
- Pagination support

### 4. Business Logic Service (`shared/services/discussion_service.py`)

#### Core Features
- **Discussion Management**: Create, read, update, delete discussions
- **Comment Management**: Threaded commenting with depth control
- **Voting System**: Upvote/downvote with vote changes and removal
- **Search & Filtering**: Advanced search with multiple criteria

- **Vote Aggregation**: Real-time vote count updates
- **Moderation Support**: Flagging and review workflows

### 5. API Endpoints (`api/routers/discussions.py`)

#### Discussion Endpoints
- `POST /api/v1/discussions/` - Create discussion
- `GET /api/v1/discussions/` - List discussions with filtering
- `GET /api/v1/discussions/{id}` - Get specific discussion
- `PUT /api/v1/discussions/{id}` - Update discussion
- `DELETE /api/v1/discussions/{id}` - Delete discussion
- `POST /api/v1/discussions/{id}/vote` - Vote on discussion

#### Comment Endpoints  
- `POST /api/v1/discussions/{id}/comments` - Create comment
- `GET /api/v1/discussions/{id}/comments` - Get comments for discussion
- `PUT /api/v1/discussions/comments/{id}` - Update comment
- `DELETE /api/v1/discussions/comments/{id}` - Delete comment
- `POST /api/v1/discussions/comments/{id}/vote` - Vote on comment

#### Analytics Endpoints
- `GET /api/v1/discussions/stats` - Get discussion statistics

### 6. Key Features Implemented

#### Authentication & Authorization
- All write operations require authentication
- Users can only edit/delete their own content
- Optional authentication for read operations (affects vote display)

#### Community Engagement
- **Upvote/Downvote System**: Full voting mechanism with vote changes
- **View Tracking**: Automatic view count increment
- **Activity Monitoring**: Last activity timestamps
- **User Vote Display**: Show user's current votes in responses

#### Content Management
- **Threaded Comments**: 5-level nested comment support
- **Soft Deletion**: Comments marked as deleted rather than removed
- **Content Validation**: Minimum length requirements for quality
- **Discussion Types**: Categorization for better organization

#### Moderation Support
- **Flagging System**: Users can flag inappropriate content
- **Flag Counting**: Track flag counts for moderator attention
- **Moderator Review**: Track moderation review status
- **Content Status**: Support for locking/archiving discussions

#### Search & Discovery
