## Integration Points

### FastAPI Application

- Observability setup during application startup
- Health check registration for critical services

### Agent System

### Database Operations
- Query timing and performance metrics

## Performance Impact

- **Logging**: ~0.5ms overhead per log entry
- **Metrics**: ~0.1ms overhead per metric recording
- **Tracing**: ~1-5ms overhead per traced operation (when enabled)
- **Health Checks**: Run every 30 seconds by default
- **Memory**: Minimal impact with structured logging and metrics

## Security Considerations

- Log scrubbing for sensitive data (PII protection)
- Metrics endpoint security (authentication required in production)
- Tracing data security (business logic protection)
- Health check information disclosure (limited details for unauthenticated users)

## Future Enhancements

### Distributed Tracing
- Full OpenTelemetry exporter installation for production
- Jaeger/Zipkin backend integration
- Cross-service trace correlation

### Advanced Monitoring
- Custom dashboards in Grafana
